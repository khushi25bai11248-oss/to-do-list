# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Managing daily tasks and staying organized is a common challenge faced by individuals. Without a simple and systematic method to track tasks, important responsibilities may be forgotten or delayed, leading to decreased productivity and increased stress. This project aims to provide a straightforward command-line solution to add, view, and delete tasks, making task management accessible and easy for users.

## Scope of the Project
This project focuses on building a basic command-line To-Do List application that supports fundamental features such as adding new tasks, viewing the list of tasks, deleting specific tasks, and exiting the program. The data is stored in memory during the runtime and is not persisted after the program exits. The project serves as an educational tool and can be extended in the future with additional features like persistence, task prioritization, and graphical user interface.

## Target Users
- Beginners learning Python programming who want a practical project.
- Individuals looking for a lightweight and simple task management tool that runs in the command line.
- Users who prefer minimalistic interfaces without the overhead of complex software.
- Educators and students interested in understanding basic CLI program structure, input handling, and list management.

## High-Level Features
- **Add Task:** Users can input and store new tasks in a running list.
- **View Tasks:** Users can display all current tasks in an ordered format.
- **Delete Task:** Users can remove a task by specifying its number in the list.
- **Exit Application:** Users can exit the program cleanly at any time.
- **Input Validation:** The system handles invalid menu choices and task indices gracefully with appropriate error messages.
