- View all current tasks in a numbered list
- Delete tasks by entering the corresponding task number
- Exit the application gracefully
- Input validation to prevent invalid task deletion or menu choices

## Technologies / Tools Used
- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies)
- Command-line interface (CLI) for interaction

## Installation & Setup
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Save the Python script (e.g., `todo_list.py`) containing the program code to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

1. Upon running the script, a menu with options will be displayed.
2. Enter the number corresponding to your desired action:
- `1` to add a task
- `2` to view all tasks
- `3` to delete a task
- `4` to exit
3. Follow on-screen prompts for each action.
4. To delete tasks, enter the task number as shown in the task list.
5. To exit, choose option `4`.

## Instructions for Testing
- Test adding tasks by selecting option `1` and entering various task descriptions.
- Test viewing tasks by choosing option `2` and confirming the displayed tasks match the added ones.
- Test deleting tasks by selecting option `3` and entering valid and invalid task numbers to verify error handling.
